# MorseCodeDetectionUsingEyeBlinks
Image processing project to encode and decode morse code messages as a form of communication

Communication is an important process through which a person can 
express his/her feelings and thoughts to the other person. Human beings have 
been communicating with one another through different modes of 
communication such as through speech, sign language and many other ways. 
Not all situations support the victim to convey help needed safely through 
hand signs or by speech. For private communication between two people, 
morse code has been developed which is highly efficient to exchange secrets 
through which people can communicate just using eye blinks. This method of 
communication is also useful for people with disabilities. Decoding and 
communication through morse code can be difficult for people who are new 
to morse code as well as for people who are familiar with morse code.

The focus of this project is to develop a platform to implement morse 
code using eye blinks in real-time assistance using a webcam to provide 
predicting power based on machine learning's tree algorithms. This platform 
also allows the end user to learn morse code by encoding a message. In this 
project, morse code is detected using image processing.
